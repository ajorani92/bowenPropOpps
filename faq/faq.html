        <strong>Why should I sell my house to you?</strong>
        <p>Great question! We are seasoned in the industry and can see all options available that most others can not. For example, once we get to know you and your situation, we can come up with at least 3 different ways to purchase your home that benefit you.</p>

        <strong>I can just list my house with a Realtor that has already promised to sell my house at a certain price. Why can't I do that?</strong>
        <p>You absolutely can do that! And a lot of people do choose to do that. But, keep in mind if you need to sell your house fast, you may want to consider a different option. A lot of Realtors out there really only care about their own best interest... the commission, and only know how to sell the house in one way. We make effort to determine what YOU need and make sure that all of our options satisfy that need.</p>

        <strong>How fast can you close?</strong>
        <p>Honestly, if everything checks out, the title work comes back clean, we can close in as little as 24 hours! Now understand; though this does happen, it's not typical. Most of our closings will happen within 14 days. Of course this is all contingent on your situation and what you need to happen. We can close later or earlier than 14 days.</p>

        <strong>What do you mean by "Making interest on my equity"?</strong>
        <p>For various reasons cash may not always be the answer. We can either pay you cash up front or make payments plus interest over time. An excellent strategy for retirement. See the benefits below for selling on terms vs cash.</p>

        <strong>Why should I trust you to make my payments?</strong>
        <p>We want to do everything we can to gain each other's trust. If you still don't feel comfortable, let us work it out. You can always call, tell us what we can do to gain your trust.</p>
